 I'm going to talk about my toy in my childhood. It is really cute bear, which is brown for the outside. And I think it is the best toy that I have ever get. It is get from my parents in my birthday and I was really hard for it. I'm most of the time I play with the toy by myself because it cannot bring to the school. I can only play at home. So it is just about myself. And sometimes I will invite my best friend come here to my home on a weekend, like this time so you play together. And I play with it like low-play song, something like that. And I feel really happy for it. And it reminds me a lot about my childhood. Since I grow up, I still keep it in my bedroom. OK? That's all.
