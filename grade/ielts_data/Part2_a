I'd like to talk about my university roommate, Xiao Wei, who's definitely one of the most opinionated people I know. We met three years ago when we were assigned to share a dorm room in our first year at university.From day one, it was clear that Xiao Wei had strong views on just about everything. Whether it was politics, music, or even the best way to organize our tiny dorm room, he always had a firm stance. I remember our first conversation about climate change - what I thought would be a casual chat turned into a passionate hour-long debate!I think Xiao Wei is such an opinionated person for a few reasons. Firstly, he's incredibly well-read and always stays up-to-date with current affairs. He devours news articles and books on various topics, which fuels his confidence in discussions. Secondly, he comes from a family of lawyers, so I suspect that debating and arguing points is somewhat in his blood. Lastly, I believe he genuinely cares about making the world better, which drives him to form and express strong opinions on important issues.
