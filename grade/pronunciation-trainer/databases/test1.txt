Um well that is a it's a difficult question.

I think er many people especially, you know, the old people they like newspapers. For example, my father he buys newspaper every day.

I think  pause  the first reason is it is a habit. Yes, a habit. They er they grow up with newspapers. So, they they are used to it. It's just normal for them.

And er another reason  pause  I think they they trust newspapers more. They think the news on TV or newspaper it is it is true. You know? They think maybe the internet  pause  the internet has too many er fake news.

So yes they trust the the old the old way. And maybe reading news paper is  thinks  more serious? Yes, serious. The internet is er just for fun, maybe.

So  summarizing  habit and and trust. That is why they don't use internet for news.
