We needed to make a waste reduction plan for our campus and nearby areas, like asking cafes to give discounts to people with their own containers. At first, I was a bit nervous because we sometimes didn't understand each other, but we used - - simple pictures to explain ideas and ask questions and the Germany students talk about their country's rules, and the Brazilian students make nice posters. We learned a lot that helps with communication. Our to with them. Diverse teams boost project effectiveness a lot. Members from different countries bring unique ideas like Germany's students' knowledge of waste rule and - Brazilian students creativity. This help made the waste reduction plan more complete, but challenges exist such as initial communication gaps. with patients and Singapore tools, this can be fixed, making the team more effective. It - - - - is very important for schools to support international students. Good support helps their work well in diverse teams. Useful resources could be language workshops to improve communication and team building activities to less students know each other better. This - - support can reduce barriers early and making collaboration easier - and the projects more - - - - successful. Different cultural problem solving ways drive innovation. Germans focus on clear rules making the plan practical. Brazilians use creativity for promotion, drawing more people's attention. This differences makes the waste reduction plan both workable and attractive. When implemented, we just need to balance this waste, which helps the plan run smoothly and better results.",
