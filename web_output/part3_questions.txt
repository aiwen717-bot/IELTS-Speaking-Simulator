1. How do you think the act of imagining and creating stories around a toy, like the bear in the text, can impact a child's cognitive and emotional development?
2. In what ways might the environment in which a child plays with their toys, such as only being allowed to play with them in their bedroom, influence their social and imaginative skills?
3. Why do you think parents often give toys as rewards for good behavior or achievements, and how might this practice affect a child's motivation and relationship with their toys?
